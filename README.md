This repository is a collection of Python code and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) concepts I learned from the Great Learning YouTube course. It covers essential topics such as:

Arrays and Strings

Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)

Stacks and Queues

Recursion and Backtracking

Searching and Sorting Algorithms

Trees and Binary Search Trees

Hashing and Heaps

Graphs and Dynamic Programming

Each topic is implemented with clean Python code, and the repo includes comments, explanations, and practice problems to reinforce understanding. A useful reference for beginners and intermediate learners preparing for coding interviews.
